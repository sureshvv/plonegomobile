 Redirecting
===================

.. contents ::

Introduction
------------

Redirecting mobile users to mobile site is critical usability factor.
 
* No matter what address the mobile user types in, he or she should be able to 
  get mobile site.
  
* The content, which the user is looking for, should not be lost if the user is being redirected
  
* The user can opt-out from the mobile site if he/she wishes

Unlike most solutions, 
Go Mobile redirector is able to match web and mobile content.
The user gets the correct content page always and is not sent to site root
when coming to the site on a mobile phone.

Redirecting logic
-----------------

* HTTP request arrives to the web site from the user browser

* Mobile browser is detected using *brand detection*

* HTTP Moved Temporary response is given and the user is taken to mobile site

* Mobile site as a link "Go to web site" which points to website.com/@@force_web

* If the user clicks this link a special cookie is not set,
  so that he/she is no longer automatically taken to mobile site from this browser
  
Web and mobile domain name mappings
-----------------------------------

By default, Go Mobile will prefixes your web site name with m. domain name prefix
and assumes this is your mobile site. This can be changed in ::doc::<settings /usermanual/settings>.

E.g. Visitor coming to yoursite.com with a mobile browser is redirected to m.yoursite.com.

Manual redirecting URLs
------------------------

Go Mobile exposes two views to all content objects which you can use to do manual redirects

* @@go_to_mobile_site

* @@go_to_web_site

These views map to URI namespaces and if use properly, they do not lose the desired
content, when redirecting.

You can add the URL expressions e.g. to site actions using the following TALES expression::

        string:${object_url}/@@go_to_mobile_site
