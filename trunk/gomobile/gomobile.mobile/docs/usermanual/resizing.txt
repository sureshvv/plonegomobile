Defloating
==========

Also, content images are defloated. This means that mobile page viewers do not 
try to wrap text around left or right of the image, because mobile screens 
do not have space for this. Instead, images are centered and image width
tries to match screen width (some padding included).

Resizing use
-------------

By default, all page body text is run through the resizer

* All <img> tags are rewritten so that images go through mobile resizer

* Also external image sources with full http:// address are supported

You can also explicitly use resizer on specific site elements, like logo,
in your theme code.
