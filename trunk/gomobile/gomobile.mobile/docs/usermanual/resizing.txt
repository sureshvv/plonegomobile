 Mobile image resizing

Introduction
------------

Go Mobile provides facilities to automatically optimize images for mobile screens.

Resizing
========

Since mobile screen come in various sizes and shapes, this is necessary for 
optimal page viewing experience.

Automatic resizing is based on browser user agent detection.

Defloating
==========

Also, content images are defloated. This means that mobile page viewers do not 
try to wrap text around left or right of the image, because mobile screens 
do not have space for this. Instead, images are centered and image width
tries to match screen width (some padding included).

Resizing your own stuff
-----------------------

By default, all page body text is run through the resizer

* All <img> tags are rewritten so that images go through mobile resizer,
  this is done by gomobiletheme.basic document_view template overriding
  the default Plone template for pages

* Also external image sources with full http:// address are supported in <img> tags.
  In this case, Python urllib is used to retrieve the external image to your own server.

You can also explicitly use resizer on specific site elements, like logo,
in your theme code. For more information, see ::doc::`Transformations in Developer Manual </developermanual/transformations>`. 

Resizer cache
-------------

File system based cache is used for resized images.
The following cache keys are used

* image width

* image height

meaning that the same result image should not be generated twice.

Currently cache must be cleaned manually using a cron job if it grows too much.

Image cache folder is defined by *image_resize_cache_path* setting. 
It is full path to the folder. Plone user must have write and read access to that path.
