Introduction
-------------

Since mobile screen estate is expensive, mobile navigation needs some
special consideration to work optimally.

Here are explained some options and rules to make navigation smooth on Go Mobile.

Mobile folder listing
----------------------

There is no navigation portlet (left side navigation).
This is the main method to navigating child content in Plone folders.

To allow easy navigation and automatic child content listing, 
each folderish content item has MobileFolderListing viewlet, defined in gomobiletheme.basic package.
It displays "Here you can also find:" label
and the summary of child content.

However, this method is impractical for folders containing more than ten to twenty items.
Automatic folder listing can be disabled on using 

*Mobile options* document action link allows you to set whether

* Folderish content item generates mobile folder listing

* Any item appears in mobile folder listing

.. note ::

        If document actions viewlet is hidden, you need to first
        make it visible using Plone's @@manage-viewlets
        functionality to access the page.

Sections
---------

Sections, i,e. top level tabs, are displayed at the bottom 
of the page.

These will contain

* All top level content items

* Tabs configured in ZMI portal_actions / portal_tabs

* Search link to the search form

* Feedback link to contact-info form

You can customize this by overriding *Sections* viewlet in gomobiletheme.basic.

Front page shortcut
-------------------

Site logo acts as front page shortcut, like it does on web pages.
