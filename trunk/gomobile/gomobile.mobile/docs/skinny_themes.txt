 Activating mobile theme
==========================

Since version 0.1 Plone Go Mobile themes are collective.skinny based.
collective.skinny is a framework to deploy lightweight plone themes
for public sites (no Plone editing functionality) easily.

Activating the theme
--------------------

# Include your theme name in eggs list - example gomobiletheme.basic::

	eggs =
	    mobile.sniffer
	    gomobile.mobile
	    gomobile.convergence
	    gomobile.supporter
	    gomobiletheme.basic
	
# Include your theme package in zcml list - example gomobiletheme.basic::
	
	zcml =
	    gomobile.imageinfo
	    gomobile.mobile
	    gomobile.convergence
	    gomobile.supporter
	    gomobiletheme.basic
	    
# Set your theme name through portal_properties.mobile_properties. Theme interface id is
  used as the key to activate the theme.
  
  
Troubleshooting
---------------

# Start Zope instance on foreground::

	bin/instance fg
	
# Inspect start up messages

# Inspect messages when you try to open your site using the web browser
