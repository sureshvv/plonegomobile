Description: GoMobile is a Plone add-on product to  Plone to converged web and mobile content management system.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - No compromises made with the mobile user experience.
        
        - Automatically reformat images and page content for mobile phone
        
        - Manage web and mobile content from the same user interface.
        
        - Mobile phone preview option for pages (admin interface).
        
        - Categorize site sections belonging to web, mobile or both (gomobile.convergence product)
        
        - Same URLs for web and mobile content (configuration option). This way pages are displayed correctly
        whether the user opens them from his web browser or mobile browser. Very handy for outgoing links in
        email.
        
        - Upload video files and they will be automatically transcoded suitable for different web and mobile platforms (commercial add on service)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        External Set up
        ===============
        
        Out-of-the-box setup needs special DNS set-up to work correctly.
        
        - There are three different request types: web, mobile and preview
        
        - Different domain names are used to identify the request type
        
        - URI stays same
        
        Edit your /etc/hosts and add line::
        
        127.0.0.1 mobi.localhost web.localhost preview.localhost
        
        Optional: It is possible to configure the server to use only single domain name. In this case,
        mobile sessions are identified by user agent sniffing and preview requests are identified by a path prefix.
        
        
        buildout.cfg
        ============
        
        Example below::
        
        # Add additional eggs here
        eggs = archetypes.schemaextender
        gomobile.imageinfo
        gomobile.mobile
        gomobile.convergence
        
        # Reference any eggs you are developing here, one per line
        # e.g.: develop = src/my.package
        develop =
        ../workspace/gomobile/gomobile.imageinfo
        ../workspace/gomobile/gomobile.mobile
        ../workspace/gomobile/gomobile.convergence
        
        # If you want to register ZCML slugs for any packages, list them here.
        # e.g. zcml = my.package my.other.package
        zcml = archetypes.schemaextender
        gomobile.imageinfo
        gomobile.mobile
        gomobile.convergence
        
        
        Add on product installers
        =========================
        
        Run add on product installers for
        
        * Plone Mobile
        
        * Convergence
        
        Site specific settings
        ======================
        
        Site specific settings can be found in ZMI. Go portal_properties -> mobile_properties.
        
        See gomobile.mobile/profiles/default/propertiestool.xml for settings descriptions.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To view web site version, go `http://web.localhost <http://web.localhost>`_.
        
        To view mobile site version, go `http://mobi.localhost <http://mobi.localhost>`_.
        
        To rearrange mobile theme viewlets, go http://mobi.localhost
        
        Portlets
        ========
        
        The following new portlets are available:
        
        * Mobile preview portlet
        
        * Content medias portlet
        
        Sitemap
        =======
        
        Sitemap has been enhanced to show content media and content language for the site administrators.
        
        Extended schema
        ===============
        
        All Plone content types will be retrofitted with the following new fields
        
        * contentMedia: convergence options - whether the content should appear in web, mobile or both. This
        setting can be inherited from parent levels.
        
        * mobileFolderListing: Show mobile specific folder listing for this content [deprecated].
        
        Mobile request discriminating
        =============================
        
        gomobile.mobile.discriminator contains an utility which categorizes the incoming HTTP requests to web, mobile and preview requests.
        
        By default, this uses domain name based policy. You can override this to use user agent based policy or cookie based policy.
        
        Image resizing
        ==============
        
        Images can be automatically resized to fit for mobile screen. The following options are availble
        
        * Scale by maximum screen width (good for logos)
        
        * Scale by maximum screen height
        
        * Manually enforce dimensions
        
        Please see gomobile.mobile.brwoser.resizer for more information about this functionality.
        
        Traffic analyzing
        -----------------
        
        Mobile sites cannot use Javascript based traffic analysing (Google Analytics).
        
        gomobile.analytics provides SQL based visitor logging
        
        * Unique visitors
        
        * Visitor revisits
        
        * Pages/visiting session
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        archetypes.schemaextender has performance issues.
        
        If this is an issue please install archetypes.schematuning package.
