Buildout instructions
---------------------

Release version
===============



Trunk version
=============

You need Google Code account for this.
It is possible to do it anonymously, but gomobile.trunk.cfg
has set links to https://.

Create Plone buildout as instructed.

Add the following::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        zope2
        ...
        ${gomobile.config:parts}

    extends =
        http://dist.plone.org/release/3.3.1/versions.cfg
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0a2
        http://plonegomobile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gomobile/gomobile.buildout/gomobile.trunk.cfg

    extensions = mr.developer

     eggs =
        Plone
        ...
        ${gomobile.config:eggs}

    [instance]
    zcml =
        ...
        ${gomobile.config:zcml}

Do some manual checkouts to get Subversion to store your passwords
and accept security certificates, so that you don't need to type them all the time.

Manual checkouts recommended::

    svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.fastview/trunk src/collective.fastview
    svn co https://mobilesniffer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mobile.sniffer src/mobile.sniffer
    svn co https://plonegomobile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gomobile/gomobile.xhtmlmp src/gomobile.xhtmlmp

Run buildout. Buildout will download and install Mr. Develop for you.
**Running buildout on the first time always fails. The purpose is to install Mr. Developer only.**

Running buildout::

    bin/buildout

Then run Mr. Developer to checkout all packages::

    bin/develop checkout ""

Then run buildout again::

    bin/buildout
